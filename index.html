    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a doctoral student at the University of Bern since 2022, working on AI in nutrition.
      I hold an MSc in Data Science with Distinction (2022) and a BSc in Information Technology with First Class Honours
      from Asia Pacific University, Malaysia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, I worked at <strong>SWIFT</strong> as a Systems and Application Management and Support Specialist,
      where I gained extensive experience in SAP Basis, SAP GRC, Linux administration, Oracle database upgrades,
      and enterprise IT operations.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My PhD research advances AI-driven dietary assessment by integrating computer vision, deep learning,
      and knowledge graphs. Key contributions include food segmentation, recognition, and volume estimation
      pipelines, out-of-distribution detection for reliability, and the development of the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph
      (accepted at ACM MM’25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Future work focuses on creating a multimodal nutrition assistant that integrates CV, LLMs, and structured
      knowledge to provide trustworthy, personalized dietary recommendations in clinical and real-world settings.
